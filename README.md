# MIT_EECS_HW1
### Homework 1 from MIT opencourseware, a calculator parser
- `hw1.pdf` is the documentation for this homework
- `providedSample.py` is the provided code sample (Python2)
- `solution.py` is my solution to the homework (Python3)
</br>

### Differences from homework documentation:
- Not using any of the class libraries, such as state machine class (created similar one at top of the file)
- In Extension for Tokenizer class, an operator will be returned immediately, as it can be tokenized the moment it is present
